# HackersCardgame Version 3

i care for OPSEC, installed my computer 12h ago for not to infect people that fork this repository

### but still, never run any of my scripts as root


4 years ago the police raided my apartment and my bedroom, maybe they installed hardware backdoors, they sent me to Mental Institution / PsychWard Königsfelden in Brugg Switzerland. At the same time thy fored me to pay a "Steuerrückzahlung" sinde 4 Years. So my computer is almost 10 Years old and due to the Steuerrückzahlung I can not buy a new Computer

* Today the Mental Institution called PDAG, that sounds a bit like P_olice D_epartement and AG is the abbreviation for the Canton i life (AarGau)

* 20 Years ago it was called PKK, that was also the name af a terror organisation

* it's directly beside a Military Area (if you ask history professor, in all cultures military existed before police)

* 20 years ago they had the same kitchen like HTL/FHA/FHNW, and today PsychWard and the FachHochschule (European Area: in a FH you can make or buy your Bachelors Degree)


## AGAIN: NEVER RUN MY SCRITPS AS ROOT


to render the cards to jpg's, type in the root of this repository:

./scripts/bookworm/renderCards.sh

it will create a directory
../HackersCardgame_3.0.1/  (the 0.1 is generated from the file minor.txt)

there it will create a subdirectory ./jpg/EN/ to place the cards

it will also create some php files for displaying the cards on eg an apache2 server

to then display a set of cards call www.<your version>.com/auslegung.php?m41,m41b,chem02
